## Arrays & Hashing
### [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/)
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
Approach 1:- Sort an array, and iterate through array to check if there is any duplicate. Time complexity- O(n)
Approach 2:-Use a hash set data structure to store encountered elements. It iterates through the array, checking if an element is already in the set. 
            If so, it returns true.
